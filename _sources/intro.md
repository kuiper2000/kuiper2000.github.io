# Syllabus 
This tropical dynamics course is based on textbook "Tropical Dynamics" by Roger Smith (2015) and Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics by Geoffrey K. Vallis. The goal of this course is to help students have general pictures of tropical climatology including (1) scale analysis in tropics (i.e., why we care about moisture more than temperature) (2) zonal mean climatology, (3) cloud, radiation and circulation, (4) tropical atmospheric and oceanic variability, and (5) troposphere and stratosphere interaction. 

Prerequisites for this class includes (1) Dynamics I & II, (2) Applied Math I&2, (3) Atmospheric Thermodynamics.
